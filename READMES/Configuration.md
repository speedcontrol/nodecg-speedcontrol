# Configuration

Speedcontrol can be used without any configuration, but you will need to do this to get most features to work, such as Twitch integration.

We use the normal [NodeCG bundle configuration](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/nodecg-configuration) so see that page for some basic details on where the configuration file should go. *tl;dr:* put a JSON file called `nodecg-speedcontrol.json` in your NodeCG installation's `cfg` folder.

If you haven't, I would recommend installing [nodecg-cli](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg-cli), then you can do either do `nodecg defaultconfig` in the bundle's directory or `nodecg defaultconfig nodecg-speedcontrol` in the NodeCG installation folder and this will create a default configuration file in the correct place with *some* of the settings you can configure already partially filled out, although you will still need to tweak this. See below for what can go in this file in more detail.

As normal with NodeCG, you will need to restart your instance of the NodeCG server when you change the config for them to be applied.

If you're an experienced user you can also check out the [configschema.json here](../configschema.json). As an additional note: if you see a configuration option avaiable in the schema that isn't documented here, assume it may change at any time.

Below is an example configuration file contents with everything that is available (*do **not** copy this and put it in directly without any modifications; it won't work, sorry*):

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "twitch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientID": "CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "CLIENT_SECRET",
    "redirectURI": "http://localhost:9090/nodecg-speedcontrol/twitchauth",
    "additionalScopes": [
      "SCOPE"
    ],
    "channelName": "OTHER_CHANNEL",
    "streamTitle": "Game: {{game}} - Category: {{category}} - Players: {{players}}",
    "tagPlayersInStreamTitle": false,
    "streamDefaultGame": "Games + Demos",
    "metadataUseExternal": false,
    "commercialsExtraButtons": false,
    "commercialsUseExternal": false,
    "ffzIntegration": false,
    "ffzUseRepeater": false
  },
  "horaro": {
    "defaultURL": "https://horaro.org/event/schedule",
    "ignoreGamesWhileImporting": [
      "Setup"
    ],
    "disableSpeedrunComLookup": false,
  },
  "oengus": {
    "defaultMarathon": "SHORTNAME",

    ],
    "disableSpeedrunComLookup": false,

  "customData": {
    "run": [
      {
        "name": "Game (Short)",
        "key": "gameShort",
        "ignoreMarkdown": false
      }
    ],
    "player": [
      {
        "name": "Other Data",
        "key": "otherData"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


## Breakdown

### Language

```json
{
  "language": "en"
}
```

This is the language code for the language used on the dashboard UI. The default is `en` (English).

The currently available languages are:
- `en` (English)
- `ja` (Japanese)

### Twitch

```json
{
  "twitch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientID": "CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "CLIENT_SECRET",
    "redirectURI": "http://localhost:9090/nodecg-speedcontrol/twitchauth",
    "additionalScopes": [
      "SCOPE"
    ],
    "streamTitle": "Game: {{game}} - Category: {{category}} - Players: {{players}}",
    "tagPlayersInStreamTitle": false,
    "streamDefaultGame": "Games + Demos",
    "metadataUseExternal": false,
    "commercialsExtraButtons": false,
    "commercialsUseExternal": false,
    "ffzIntegration": false,
    "ffzUseRepeater": false
  }
}
```

This is the part where the Twitch integration configuration is set up. Make sure `enabled` is true (it defaults to `false`), and then you will need to [create a Twitch API app yourself from their developer site](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) and put in the supplied client ID and client secret. The redirect URI should be the same as the one above unless you are **not** running your NodeCG server locally and/or you changed the port it uses.

- `streamTitle` is a string that specifies what the title will be updated to when a run is switched. There are some wildcards as seen above that will be replaced with the relevant data if they're specified. Leave it blank if you don't want to have the title updated.
- `tagPlayersInStreamTitle` is a boolean (defaults to `false`) for, if you have set the players to appear in the title using the above configuration option, their names to be replaced with their Twitch usernames instead, which allows them to be "tagged" on the Twitch website itself and become links to those channels.
- `streamDefaultGame` is the game in the Twitch directory that will be used if the game name from your schedule cannot be found in the directory.

FrankerFaceZ integration can also be enabled with `ffzIntegration`, this will make it so people who use the browser extension see the player(s) as a "featured" channel for easy following, and if enabled on your channel, will also add their FrankerFaceZ emoticons for use during their run (you will need to ask the devs of the extension to enable this for you).

Once the Twitch integration settings are fully set up and your NodeCG server has been (re)started, you will see a "Connect with Twitch" button on the dashboard, which can be used to authorise nodecg-speedcontrol with Twitch.

For most people, it is advised that you connect using the same account that you want the information updated for. ***Unfortunately it is no longer possible to just be an editor for a channel that you specify in `channelName`, due to Twitch API permission changes.*** If you cannot log into said account, you will need to find a workaround, see the "Advanced Users" section below.

There is also another optional parameter, `additionalScopes`, which is an array of strings, which if any are specified will be added to the Twitch authorisation request and allow the token to have more control, which can be useful if you plan to use the [Twitch API request feature](./API/NodeCG-Messages.md#twitchAPIRequest) feature. By default we request these scopes, so if you specify these again they will be ignored:
- `channel:edit:commercial`
- `channel:manage:broadcast`
- `chat:read`
- `chat:edit`

The `commercialsExtraButtons` option adds more buttons on the *Twitch Control* dashboard panel (3:30 - 6:00); these will only work if your Twitch channel is allowed to run commercials of that length.

**Advanced Users:**

If you cannot log into the Twitch account that you will be changing the information on, you will need to find a workaround that involves an external bundle, for example it may involve an external server that you send requests to, that you then ask the owner of the channel to log in to. To help with this, we offer these settings (set any of them to true to activate them). Note that if using any of these settings, this bundle will update the our information assuming that any other bundle you have programmed has worked correctly, without you needing to respond.

- `metadataUseExternal`: instead of this bundle changing the title/game, we will emit the [`twitchExternalMetadata`](./API/NodeCG-Messages.md#twitchExternalMetadata) message, and allow you to handle it yourself.
- `commercialsUseExternal`: instead of this bundle running commercials, we will emit the [`twitchExternalCommercial`](./API/NodeCG-Messages.md#twitchExternalCommercial) message, and allow you to handle them yourself.
- `ffzUseRepeater`: instead of this bundle setting the FrankerFaceZ featured channels, we will emit the [`repeaterFeaturedChannels`](./API/NodeCG-Messages.md#repeaterFeaturedChannels) message, and allow you to handle them yourself.

You will very likely also want to add/change `channelName` in the configuration to the channel you wish to pull the information from that gets pre-filled in the *Twitch Control* dashboard panel.


### Horaro Schedule

```json
{
  "horaro": {
    "defaultURL": "https://horaro.org/event/schedule",
    "ignoreGamesWhileImporting": [
      "Setup"
    ],
    "disableSpeedrunComLookup": false
  }
}
```

- `defaultURL` is a URL to the schedule on Horaro that will be pre-filled on the dashboard; usually you will only be using your setup for 1 marathon so this means you don't need to keep entering it every time you want to do a (re)import.
- `ignoreGamesWhileImporting` is an array of strings of games on your schedule that will be ignored on import; for example you may have setup blocks you don't want importing. This does partial matches ("Setup Block" will be matched by "Setup").
- `disableSpeedrunComLookup` is a boolean (defaults to `false`) that can be enabled, which will skip the speedrun.com look-ups during schedule import; by default the import will try to find the player's Twitch username, country and pronouns from speedrun.com, but if you do not need this you can disable it to speed up the import.


### Oengus Schedule

```json
{
  "oengus": {
    "defaultMarathon": "SHORTNAME",
    "defaultSchedule": "SLUG",
    "ignoreGamesWhileImporting": [
      "Setup"
    ],
    "disableSpeedrunComLookup": false,
    "useSandbox": false
  }
}
```

- `defaultMarathon` is the marathon's shortname on Oengus that will be pre-filled on the dashboard; this is the part of the URL *after* `oengus.io/marathon/`.
- `defaultSchedule` is the marathon's schedule slug on Oengus that will be pre-filled on the dashboard; this is the part of the URL *after* `oengus.io/marathon/{shortname}/schedule/`.
- `ignoreGamesWhileImporting` is an array of strings of games on your schedule that will be ignored on import. This does partial matches ("Setup Block" will be matched by "Setup"). Currently this does not check specific setup blocks created in Oengus.
- `disableSpeedrunComLookup` is a boolean (defaults to `false`) that can be enabled, which will skip the speedrun.com look-ups during schedule import; by default the import will try to find the player's Twitch username (if not already linked via Oengus) and country from speedrun.com, but if you do not need this you can disable it to speed up the import.
- `useSandbox` will make all lookups use the [sandbox version of Oengus](https://sandbox.oengus.io/) instead of the live version; useful for testing.


### Custom Data

```json
{
  "customData": {
    "run": [
      {
        "name": "Game (Short)",
        "key": "gameShort",
        "ignoreMarkdown": false
      }
    ],
    "player": [
      {
        "name": "Other Data",
        "key": "otherData"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

*For advanced users!*

This is the part where you configure "custom data" that will also be able to be added/edited alongside any data the bundle can already handle.

- `run` is where the custom *run* data is configured; this is an array of objects. Anything configured here has the chance to appear within an object called `customData` within the run's data object. This will allow you to add a custom column when importing from a Horaro schedule and also edit/add these custom data values from the relevant dialog.
  - `name` is the formatted name that will appear in the Speedcontrol UI.
  - `key` is the key that will be used in the `customData` in the run data.
  - `ignoreMarkdown` is a boolean (defaults to `false`) which if true, will tell the Horaro import to not attempt to strip any markdown in the column's data for that run.
- `player` is where the custom *player* data is configured; this is an array of objects. Anything configured here has the chance to appear within an object called `customData` within the player's data object *inside* of the run data object. This is not automatically imported from anywhere as of yet and can only be added/edited via the dashboard.
  - `name` is the formatted name that will appear in the Speedcontrol UI.
  - `key` is the key that will be used in the `customData` in the player data.
